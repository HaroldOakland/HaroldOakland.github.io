    <p><aside class="biographyFontSize">Pluto is a cold, distant world...well, mini world...but I wouldn't be
       who I am if I weren't nurtured in the frigid bussom of the methane ice
       caves our people eventually settled. Once I moved to Earth, I discovered
       sweating and let me tell you, I hate it. However, there aren't any
       tamales at the poles either, so I live in Denver. There aren't many
       tamales here, nor any methane caves, but I like it here.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>I grok with a woman who is my wife and we enjoy multiple activities and
       of course, good alcoholic beverages. Now I find myself pecking away at a
       keyboard attempting to learn how to make graphical interfaces for users
       to interact with so I can make some money.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>I know I'll never return to the desolate methane tundra of Pluto, and I
       know that I do not want to. However, I do still miss carving out reliefs
       on the cave walls using only my warm breath. Feel free to head over to
       the contact form and leave a message!</aside>
